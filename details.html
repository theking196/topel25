  <h2>Papa T's Journey</h2>
  <p>
    Papa T completed his WAEC at Stars Secondary School in Lagos and went on to study at a university in the Benin Republic. His life has always been anchored in spiritual purpose and leadership.
    <br><br>
    In 2019, he received the vision for The Kingdom Mandate (TKM), launching the fellowship with faith and passion. Though it paused briefly, the mandate revived stronger in 2020, igniting a community of purposeful teenagers across Lagos and beyond.

  <h2>Sister Pelumi's Testimony</h2>
  <p>
    A graduate of Physiology from Babcock University, Sister Pelumi has served her church and community with grace and diligence. Her parish is part of the area overseen by Papa T‚Äôs church headquarters.
    <br><br>
    It was during a workers‚Äô retreat organized by the area that her path crossed Papa T‚Äôs ‚Äî a divine alignment that began as friendship and bloomed into purpose-filled love.

  <h2>The Kingdom Mandate</h2>
  <p>
    TKM started as a small prayer and mentorship movement in 2019, founded by Papa T. After a brief season of closure, it returned in 2020 with renewed strength and clarity.
    <br><br>
    Through TKM, countless teens have found vision, accountability, and leadership. This wedding is one of its most beautiful testimonies ‚Äî a union built through ministry, mentorship, and grace.
