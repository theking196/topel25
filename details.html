  <h2>Papa T's Journey</h2>
  <p>
    Papa T completed his WAEC at Stars Secondary School in Lagos and went on to study at a university in the Benin Republic. His life has always been anchored in spiritual purpose and leadership.
    <br><br>
    In 2019, he received the vision for The Kingdom Mandate (TKM), launching the fellowship with faith and passion. Though it paused briefly, the mandate revived stronger in 2020, igniting a community of purposeful teenagers across Lagos and beyond.

  <h2>Sister Pelumi's Testimony</h2>
  <p>
    A graduate of Physiology from Babcock University, Sister Pelumi has served her church and community with grace and diligence. Her parish is part of the area overseen by Papa T’s church headquarters.
    <br><br>
    It was during a workers’ retreat organized by the area that her path crossed Papa T’s — a divine alignment that began as friendship and bloomed into purpose-filled love.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section px-3 py-4">
  <h2>Divine Intersections</h2>
  <p>
    Their story began at a workers’ retreat organized by the area headquarters of Papa T’s church. Both of them initially didn’t want to attend — but God had other plans.
    <br><br>
    When Sister Pelumi arrived with her church bus, she was greeted by a few familiar faces, including Bro John — her fellow youth president. Papa T also greeted her and reminded her he had seen her before at Mummy Funke’s singles program.
    <br><br>
    That evening, she was given the mic to lead a prayer session. The moment she spoke, Papa T felt something shift. “She sounded my sound,” he would later say. He couldn't stop watching her.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section px-3 py-4">
  <h2>Confirmations and Conversations</h2>
  <p>
    During the break, Papa T told Bro John, “I think I’ve found my wife.” That night, he casually invited her to join him in ministering to the children — she would lead worship, and he would share the Word.
    <br><br>
    After that moment, they stayed in touch. He told her his intentions early on. Unknown to him, God had already spoken to her that a man deeply involved in teens ministry was coming for her.
  </p>
</section>

<section class="section px-3 py-4">
  <h2>The Proposal</h2>
  <p>
    Their first date was at Chicken Republic. Nervous but ready, Papa T asked her to read Proverbs 18:22. When she opened it — “He that findeth a wife findeth a good thing…” — he told her plainly, “I believe I’ve found my wife in you.”
    <br><br>
    Though she said she'd get back to him, he already knew the answer. She said yes officially on August 4 after months of prayerful friendship.

  <h2>Final Note</h2>
  <p>
    Before even knowing her, Papa T had encountered her family. He sat beside her mum during a program and felt drawn in the spirit. Later, when he informed her pastor’s wife of his intentions, the reply was humorous — “Are you sure?” For someone who “wasn’t giving any guy face,” this divine alignment was clear.
    <br><br>
    Their union is not just romantic — it’s revival-centered, purpose-driven, and kingdom-certified.
